/**
 * Hook that increments/decrements the open layer count when the component mounts/unmounts or becomes visible/hidden.
 * It is used to "notify" the layer observer(s) that a new layer has been added/opened.
 *
 * It takes an object with two arguments:
 * - `isOpen` - used to conditionally update the layer count based on the visibility of the layered component.
 * - `onClose` - callback used to close this layer when the OpenLayerObserver has called `closeLayers`.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```tsx
 * const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false); // State for controlling layer visibility
 * useNotifyLayerObserver({
 *   isOpen,
 *   onClose: () => setIsOpen(false) // Optional callback to close this layer
 * });
 * ```
