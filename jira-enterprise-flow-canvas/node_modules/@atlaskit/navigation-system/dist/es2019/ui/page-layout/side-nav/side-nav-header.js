     * This attribute is used to identify whether the SideNavHeader is mounted, to determine where the
     * SideNavContent's scroll indicator line should be applied. This is for layering reasons -
     * if the scroll indicator line intersects with the top nav, it could incorrectly be hidden beneath
     * the top nav (depending on if a layer is open, which raises the top nav'z z-index).
     *
     * We are using a data attribute and CSS for this logic to ensure it is SSR safe.
     *
     * - If SideNavHeader exists, the scroll indicator line is applied to the SideNavContent. This is safe
     * because the SideNavHeader is between the SideNavContent and TopNavStart, so the scroll indicator line
     * will not intersect with the top nav.
     *
     * - If SideNavHeader does not exist, the scroll indicator line is applied to TopNavStart. This ensures
     * the scroll indicator line is visible even when the top nav has a z-index higher than the side nav.
